# CountryDB
This is a simple JavaFX application covering some of the basic features of the framework.

The project aims to explore some of the key features of JavaFX like Properties, Bindings and Observable Collections.
It also displays implementations of concurrent tasks with the help of the new Service and Task classes available in the `javafx.concurrent` package.

The sample project uses the [RestCountries API](https://restcountries.eu/) for country information and the [Country Flags API](https://countryflags.io/) for downloading flag images in PNG format.

Testing is done using the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library.
